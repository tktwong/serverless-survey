service: create-account

# Example serverless.com project that will use StepFunctions send an email after account is created.
# This is intended as an example do demonstrate how to automate and extend the account creation process.

# In your organization you might want to do something a lot less manual:
# e.g: automatically create a ticket, update a wiki or perform tasks in the created account.
# Maybe integrate a library like [https://github.com/sentialabs/coto](https://github.com/sentialabs/coto)

# Note that currently events are published in the `us-east-1` region.
# If you would like events to be raised in a different region, please raise a ticket:
# https://github.com/OlafConijn/AwsOrganizationFormation/issues

custom:
  # used as a prefix to resources
  resourcePrefix: my-account-creation

  # replace both values with the from and to email addresses you would like to use.
  # email addresses need to be 'verified' in SES.
